% \begin{itemize}
% \item Investigate and implement deep-learning methods for synthetic fetal ultrasound imaging of normal and abnormal cases;
% \item Propose and apply methods to evaluate quantitative and qualitative images to investigate fetal biomechanics; and 
% \item Design and  test fetal phantoms that mimic various poses, and fetal ages.
